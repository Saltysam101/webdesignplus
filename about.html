        <h1 class="subheading">A Little Bit About Us</h1>
        <p>Cheryl and I got married in August 2019; so we are considered a new couple, but we love our modest house with our two dogs  and our three crazy cats. Even though our marriage is newer, we are excited for what life has in store for us and the new adventures that await us; including starting up our own business. We are eager to find new challenges that await us, but we are mostly excited to share these experiences with all the new people we cant wait to meet and help out.</p>

        <h1 class="subheading">How We Got Started</h1>
        <p>It all started with me wanting to make websites but I lacked design capabilities. That's where my wife comes in. She designs and I code! Win-Win!</p>
        <h1 class="subheading">Our Objective</h1>
        <p>Our objective is to make functional websites that look amazing at a reasonable price.</p>
        <h1 class="subheading">Who We Serve</h1>
        <p>We will mainly focus on businesses, but anyone who needs a website is free to contact us.</p>
